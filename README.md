# Bachelor Thesis
This GitHub repository stores the code and data accompanying the Bachelor Thesis titled "An Evaluation of the Navigation Performance of Polygonal and Grid-Based Maps in Industrial Robot Fleets".

The repository contains two folders: `code` and `data`.

- The `code` directory includes all code that was modified or created for the thesis. This includes a folder with the [catkin workspace](code/catkin_ws/) for ROS, as well as created [scripts](code/scripts) used for acquiring the test data.

- The `data` folder includes all raw data from both tested navigation stacks. Each test is separated into its own folder.
